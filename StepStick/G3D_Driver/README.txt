G3D driver
==========
This is the new innovative stepper motor driver for your 3D printer or any task involved stepper motors! It is a new generation as replacement for Pololu/StepStick.

Professional design ensure stable operation of this driver - it contain 2oz copper PCB for better heat dissipation and 0.1ohm sense resistors which let it working up to 2A (heatsink and additional air cooling is needed for operating over 1A).

Using standard A4988 drivers you face the problem of vibration / shaking stepper motors and frame when stepper motors are moving (most noticeable on Z stage). These drivers solves this problem by using an additional 30k trimpot to correctly select the off-time settings.
